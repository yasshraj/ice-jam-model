# ice-jam-model

Developed an ice jam prediction model in Python to forecast potential ice jam occurrences in Nebraska rivers using different Indexes and machine learning techniques. These spectral indices are used to automatically outline landscape features like snow/ice, clouds, vegetation and water in Landsat imagery, where they create an 'index stack' using the sets. Also utilized libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, Regression and visualization.
